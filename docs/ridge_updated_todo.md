- [ ] Agent configuration caching
- [ ] API response caching for common patterns
- [ ] Cache invalidation on file changes

#### Cache Management
- [ ] `ridge cache status` command
- [ ] `ridge cache clear` command

- [ ] Batch error handling and recovery
- [ ] Different model selection for batch vs individual

### Phase 7: Watch Mode & Advanced Features (2-3 hours)
**Goal**: Real-time file monitoring and automated responses

#### Watch Mode
- [ ] `--watch` flag for file monitoring
- [ ] Auto-response to file changes
- [ ] Configurable watch patterns
- [ ] Watch mode termination handling

#### Advanced Commands
- [ ] `ridge project analyze --architect` (full project review)
- [ ] `ridge project health` (comprehensive health check)
- [ ] Static analysis integration (ESLint, Pylint)

### Phase 8: Error Handling & Polish (1-2 hours)
**Goal**: Production-ready stability and user experience

#### Error Recovery
- [ ] API failure fallbacks with cached responses

## ðŸš€ MOTIVATION & CONTEXT

**Why This Matters**: Ridge Base isn't just a learning project - it's becoming a real AI development assistant that will make Brian a more effective developer. Every feature we add makes coding faster, smarter, and more enjoyable.

**Current State**: We have a working AI file analyzer with memory - that's already incredibly valuable!

**Next Milestone**: File editing and creation will complete the core CRUD operations for AI-assisted development.

**Vision**: A CLI tool that acts like having a team of expert developers (debug specialist, architect, teacher, manager) available instantly for any coding task.

**Status**: Ready for Phase 4B - File Editing & Creation
**Confidence**: HIGH - All hard problems solved, proven architecture
**Motto**: Work hard and have fun! not_done_yet! ðŸ’ª
